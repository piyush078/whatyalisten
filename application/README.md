## Application

This folder contains the front-end of the project. It interacts with the client and fetches the API from the server to show it on the webpage using [Angular](http://angular.io/).

### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
